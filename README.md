# CS231N-notes-and-assignments

Thanks for the Stanford open course CS231N, the team have done great work!

These assignments are extraordinary.

This repository contains my solutions and some resources, like [studying plans](https://github.com/Richardyu114/CS231N-notes-and-assignments/blob/master/study%20plans%20from%20deepshare.md) from deepshare.

Besides, I also writing some Chinese [notes](https://densecollections.top/2020/02/29/Stanford-CS231n-%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0/) for this course. Hope it be useful for you.
